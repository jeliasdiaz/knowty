                We add "s," "es," or "ies" to the verb in the third person

                verbs "do" and "does," with the latter being used for the third

            The easiest way to use a/an is to identify if the word we want to
            allude to begins with a vowel, if so we use "an" (an apple). If it
            starts with a consonant, we use "a" (a pizza).
